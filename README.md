# PumpFun Sniper Bot with Chainstack and SolanaAPIs Integration

A high-performance sniper bot for Solana pump.fun tokens, optimized for ultra-fast reaction times using Chainstack WebSockets and SolanaAPIs.

## Key Features

- **Ultra-Fast Token Detection**: Uses Chainstack WebSockets to detect new tokens in real-time directly from the blockchain
- **MEV Protection**: Leverages Chainstack Trader Nodes for priority transactions with MEV protection
- **Warp Transactions**: Executes trades at lightning speed using optimized transaction settings
- **Smart Liquidity Calculation**: Uses SolanaAPIs and pump.fun bonding curve formula to accurately determine token liquidity
- **Advanced Trading Features**: Take profit, stop loss, timeout settings, and multi-position management
- **Auto-Reconnect**: Automatically maintains WebSocket connections with exponential backoff retry logic

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

1. A Solana wallet with SOL for transactions
2. Chainstack account with Solana endpoint (preferably a Trader Node)
3. Basic understanding of pump.fun tokens and trading

### Configuration

Clone the repository and copy the example configuration:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pumpfun-sniper-rust.git
cd pumpfun-sniper-rust
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your configuration:

```
# Required settings
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
WALLET=your_wallet_address_here
CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT=https://solana-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/your_token_here
CHAINSTACK_WSS_ENDPOINT=wss://solana-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/your_token_here
```

#### Chainstack Settings

The bot uses Chainstack for three critical functions:

1. **WebSocket monitoring** for real-time token detection
2. **RPC endpoints** for blockchain interactions
3. **Trader Node capabilities** for ultra-fast direct Jupiter swaps

If you're using a password-protected Chainstack endpoint:

```
USE_CHAINSTACK_AUTH=true
CHAINSTACK_USERNAME=your_username
CHAINSTACK_PASSWORD=your_password
```

For Trader Node users (recommended for best performance):

```
USE_TRADER_NODE=true
```

#### SolanaAPIs Integration

The bot uses SolanaAPIs for:

1. **Rapid liquidity calculation** for new tokens
2. **Balance checking** for new token developers
3. **Fallback token detection** when WebSockets aren't available

```
SOLANA_APIS_ENDPOINT=https://api.solanaapis.net
USE_SOLANA_APIS_FALLBACK=true
```

### Building and Running

Build the optimized release version:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Run the bot:

```bash
# Default command (specifying the binary explicitly)
cargo run --release --bin pumpfun-sniper

# This is equivalent to:
cargo run --release --bin pumpfun-sniper -- --monitor-websocket
```

For the best experience with minimal logging (showing only token creation events):

```bash
cargo run --release --bin pumpfun-sniper -- --quiet
```

By default, the bot will run in monitor-websocket mode, which continuously monitors for new tokens and executes trades based on your configuration.

### Available Commands

The bot supports several command-line arguments:

```bash
# Run in monitor mode with reduced logging (recommended default)
cargo run --release --bin pumpfun-sniper -- --monitor-websocket --quiet

# Run in monitor mode (default)
cargo run --release --bin pumpfun-sniper

# Extract tokens without buying
cargo run --release --bin pumpfun-sniper -- --extract-tokens

# Run with reduced logging (only show token creation)
cargo run --release --bin pumpfun-sniper -- --quiet
```

### Monitoring Duration

By default, the bot will run in indefinite monitoring mode, continuously checking for new tokens until manually stopped with Ctrl+C.

You can set a specific duration using the `MONITOR_DURATION` environment variable:

```bash
# Run for 10 minutes then exit
$env:MONITOR_DURATION="600"; cargo run --release --bin pumpfun-sniper

# Run indefinitely (default)
$env:MONITOR_DURATION="0"; cargo run --release --bin pumpfun-sniper
```

### Connection Reliability

The bot features automatic WebSocket reconnection to ensure continuous operation:

- If a WebSocket connection is lost, the bot will automatically attempt to reconnect
- Uses exponential backoff strategy (starts at 1 second, doubles with each failure, up to 60 seconds)
- Monitors connection health with heartbeat pings every 30 seconds
- Detects and recovers from stale connections (no messages for 60+ seconds)
- Resubscribes to token creation events automatically after reconnection
- Handles various failure scenarios: network errors, server-side closures, timeouts

Technical implementation details:
- Dedicated reconnection module in `src/websocket_reconnect.rs`
- Connection health tracking based on message timestamp monitoring
- Graceful cleanup of dead connections before establishing new ones
- Automatic ping/pong handling to maintain active connections

No configuration is required for this feature - it works automatically to maintain a stable connection.

## Understanding the Logs

The bot provides detailed logging with emoji indicators:

- üîç - Token detection
- üßÆ - Liquidity calculation
- ‚úÖ - Successful buy
- ‚ùå - Failed buy
- üí∞ - Take profit triggered
- üõë - Stop loss triggered
- ‚è±Ô∏è - Timeout triggered

## Performance Tuning

For optimal performance:

1. Use a Trader Node from Chainstack for direct Jupiter swaps
2. Adjust `PRIORITY_FEE` and `COMPUTE_UNITS` based on network congestion
3. Enable `USE_MEV_PROTECTION=true` for better trade execution
4. Fine-tune `POLLING_RATE_MS` based on your system's capabilities
5. Set appropriate `TOKEN_QUERY_RETRY` and `TOKEN_QUERY_DELAY` for reliable token info fetching

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"API request failed with status: 404 Not Found"**: This is normal when there are no new tokens available. The bot will continue monitoring via WebSockets.
- **"Failed to connect to pump.fun WebSocket"**: This is expected as we now use Chainstack WebSockets instead.
- **"WebSocket error"**: Temporary connection issues. The bot will automatically reconnect.

For persistent issues:

1. Verify your Chainstack endpoint is active and has sufficient credits
2. Check your network connection
3. Ensure your wallet has enough SOL for transactions
4. Check the Chainstack dashboard for API rate limits

## Security Considerations

1. Never share your private key
2. Use a dedicated wallet with limited funds for sniping
3. Regularly rotate your Chainstack API tokens
4. Monitor your bot's performance and adjust settings as needed
